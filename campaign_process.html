      <h2>Ad Campaign: Healthy Eating</h2>
      <p>Ad campaign centered around
convincing young adults to
adopt healthier eating behaviors; particularly in regards to the cost
of healthy food.<br><br>I aimed to tie
the routine based relationship
that many young people have
with cosemetic products to their
relationship with food. The text was
treated as a graphic element
to give the piece more visual
interest. Borrowing iconography
from farming and healthy food’s
packaging also helps to give the
pieces a warmer and less clinical
feel.</p>

      <p>One essential part of the process for this project was writing goals. I used an "OIIC" format to outline my goals. OIIC is an acronym for "objective, issue, insight, and challenge." Here's an example: <br><br>
Objective: Convince young adults (18-30) that buying locally grown/sold produce is
worth the cost because of the health benefits.<br>
Issue: Young adults are aware that eating healthy foods is good for your health.
However, they still do not make it a high priority.<br>
Insight: Young adults are more concerned with their appearance than both younger
and older age demographics. They spend a lot of money on products that they feel
make themselves appear more attractive.<br>
Challenge: Highlight the positive effect that eating healthy foods has on one’s
appearance. <br><br> This was key in helping me find my exact target audience, and in coming up with a game plan for how best to communicate to that audience.</p>

<p>Because of the simplicity of the design that I landed on, good photography was essential. I didn't have access to a lighting studio, so it took some time and ingenuity to get it right. Eventually by using some drawing paper for a seamless white background and some very precarious lighting techniques, I was able to get some decent shots. Following this, I worked through many different graphic and typogrphic ideas, finally settling on a sort of faux farm sticker design. I wanted it to look like a label that you might see in a grocery store or at a farmers market, so I leaned into the fake distressed aesthetic that many healthy and organic brands capitalize on. Finally, after many hours in photoshop making up for my sub-par product photography, I finalized my design. </p>
